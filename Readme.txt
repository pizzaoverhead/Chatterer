Chatterer
=========

A plugin for Kerbal Space Program from SQUAD, which adds some SSTV, beeps, and nonsensical radio chatter between your crewed command pods and Mission Control.
There is also some environmental sounds as : wind in atmosphere, breathing on EVA and background noises inside space-crafts.

Installation :

- Unzip 'Chatterer_x.x.x.zip' file anywhere you see fit,
- Copy only the 'Chatterer' folder (and its content) you will find under 'Chatterer_x.x.x\GameData'
- Then paste this 'Chatterer' folder in your KSP 'GameData' folder.

Usage :

- Chattering/background noises should start automatically upon flight start,
- you will see the Chatterer button on your application toolbar on the upper right of the screen,
- Click on it to access Chatterer settings (watch for tooltips).

(optional when using Blizzy78's Toolbar Mod)
- if you have Blizzy78's Toolbar Mod installed, you can also find a Chatterer Icon available (must be enabled on first load),
- you can also choose to use Blizzy78's Toolbar only and hide KSP stock applauncher button (check Chatterer settings).
